<h1>Unrated</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/d/d6/UI_Icon_Modes_Competitive.png/revision/latest?cb=20200805002134" alt="Unrated" style="width:400px;height:300px;"
		>
		<p>Unrated is VALORANT's standard Plant/Defuse mode. Teams play 12 rounds on Attack or Defense, then swap to the other side for the next 12 rounds. The first to 13 rounds wins (Bo25), with a final Endgame round played should the game reach a 12-12 scoreline.

This mode lasts for 30-40 minutes.
</p>
		

<h1>Competetive</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/d/d6/UI_Icon_Modes_Competitive.png/revision/latest?cb=20200805002134" alt="Competetive" style="width:400px;height:300px;"
		>
		<p>Competitive is a higher stakes version of Unrated where you play competitively against other players to earn and compete for a rank.

Should a game reach a 12-12 scoreline, the games instead goes into Overtime where the first team to get a 2-round lead on their opponent wins the game. Players can vote every two rounds on whether to continue Overtime, which can result in the game ending in a draw should enough players vote for this option.

This mode lasts for 30-40 minutes.
</p>

<h1>Replication</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/0/06/TX_Replication_Icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20210511155307" alt="Replication" style="width:400px;height:300px;"
		>
		<p>Replication is 5v5 Bo9 mode where all players on a team play as the same agent. Players vote for an agent they want to play and the game then randomly selects one of the choices.

Replication has an estimated game time of 10-15 minutes and grants the same amount of XP as Unrated (100 XP per round plus 200 XP for every won round).
</p>

<h1>Spike Rush</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/8/82/UI_Icon_Modes_Spike_Rush.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/128?cb=20200607210504" alt="Spike Rush" style="width:400px;height:300px;"
		>
		<p>Spike Rush is a Bo7 5v5 mode where all players start each round with the same random weapon. Random orbs spawn around the map that players can collect to grant buff for themselves and/or their teammates or afflict enemies with debuffs.

</p>

<h1>Deathmatch</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/a/a9/TX_FFAModeIcon.png/revision/latest?cb=20200805002133" alt="Deathmatch" style="width:400px;height:300px;"
		>
		<p>Deathmatch is a type of game mode where the objective is tied in some way to killing enemies. These modes can either be free-for-all or team based. Players have an infinite amount of lives and upon being killed will respawn at a random location after a short delay.
Deathmatch is a 12-player free-for-all game mode designed to allow players to hone their gunplay mechanics without abilities or warm up before playing Competitive. Players equip weapons of their choice and kill anyone in their way until either a player reaches 40 kills or 9 minutes have passed, at which point the game will end.

Deathmatch grants 900 XP for completing the game, but cannot be used to complete missions.
</p>

<h1>Escalation</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/1/19/TX_GunGame_Icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20210611142525" alt="Escalation" style="width:400px;height:300px;"
		>
		<p>Escalation is a 5v5 team deathmatch mode where players kill and race the enemy team through a cycle of different weapons and abilities, advancing together as a team through Escalation levels. The first team to finish level 12, or the furthest along in 10 minutes, wins the game. Each level has a specific weapon or ability that the player is equipped with. Killing enemies grants points for the team that help to advance levels.

Escalation games run for about 7â€“9 minutes, and grant 800 XP for completing the game, plus 200 XP for the winning team.
</p>

<h1>Snowball Fight</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/9/9e/TX_SnowballFight_Icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20210623221607" alt="Snowball Fight" style="width:400px;height:300px;"
		>
		<p>Snowball Fight is a 5v5 team deathmatch mode where the first team to 50 kills wins. All players only have access to a Snowball Launcher that fires lethal projectile-based snowballs. Gifts also appear on the map that contain temporary power ups for the player. These can increase the launcher's rate of fire, increase snowball size, let snowballs ricochet, or increase the player's movement speed and max jump height.

Snowball Fight granted 750 XP for each game completed, and 150 bonus XP for the winning team, but cannot be used to progress missions.
