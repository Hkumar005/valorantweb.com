		<h1>Jett</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/valorant/images/7/79/Jett_artwork.png/revision/latest?cb=20200602020209" alt="Jettz" style="width:350px;height:500px;"
		>
		<p>Representing her home country of South Korea, Jett's agile and evasive fighting style lets her take risks no one else can. She runs circles around every skirmish, cutting enemies before they even know what hit them. Sunwoo Han hails from South Korea, with possible links to the Insa-dong neighborhood in Seoul. As a chef in her early life, she was involved in an incident relating to her wind-like radiant powers at the restaurant she worked at, causing a "freak storm" that all but destroyed the building. Sunwoo fled the scene soon after.

Later on, Sunwoo would be recruited by the VALORANT Protocol to become its tenth agent, "Jett". Whilst working for the Protocol however, an incident occurred in Venice that destroyed part of the city. When authorities issued warrants for the arrests of the perpetrators, one of them was revealed to look exactly identical to Jett. Though Jett herself had nothing to do with the mission, the rest of the world now believed that she was now a threat to them. She couldn't explain that it wasn't her to those she know outside of VALORANT, unable to even understand what was going on herself, and it left them feeling disgusted, horrified, and ashamed at her, forcing her to go on the run once more.

It has since been understood that the lookalike was actually a mirror version of herself from another Earth, clearing Jett of any wrongdoing. Unable to reveal any info associated with the VALORANT Protocol however, and unable to convince anyone of her innocence in a population that knows nothing of alternate Earths, to the rest of the world Jett remains one of its most dangerous radiants.

		<p>Tayane Alves is an engineer coming from Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, with a strong enthusiasm for explosives and paint - usually combined. Holding strong objections towards Kingdom Corporation's operations in Bahia, Alves was involved in driving the company out of her home state and forcing them to abandon their sites there, the marks of her tools staining the plots as a testament to her victories. Hired since then to work for the VALORANT Protocol as its twelfth agent, "Raze", Alves now sows her chaos against bigger threats to Earth. However, as the paint fades from Salvador's walls, Raze cannot afford to leave her home completely behind, lest Kingdom look to make its return there.

		>
		<p>Sabine Callas hails from the United States, with possible links to Seattle. Holding a doctorate and awards such as the R. Francis Prize and the Denton Outstanding Innovation Award, her previous occupations include roles with Kingdom Corporation, eventually becoming its first Chief Scientific Officer on the board of advisors, and influence over the conglomerate's ventures in Rabat, Morocco. It has also been suggested by her fellow agents that she used to be some sort of healer. At some point during her time at Kingdom however, there was an "incident". Little is known about what happened, but everything changed for Callas at that point after all she lost because of it, isolating and dedicating herself to pursuing vengeance instead.

After the events of First Light, the secretive VALORANT Protocol was founded, with Callas becoming its second agent, "Viper", and one of its founders. Despite this, the Protocol would eventually have its seventh recruit, Sage, as its second-in-command under Brimstone. Viper's opinion on whether she wanted to be in such a leadership position or not is currently unknown. At some point, Viper was also involved in Erik Torsten's recruitment as the thirteenth agent of the Protocol.

Since the rise of Venice and the numerous battles the disaster triggered, Viper has been seen leading multiple missions across the globe, including one to Rabat to prevent a spike detonation and another to New Mexico to do a preliminary sweep of a destroyed research facility. Another mission had her accompanying Brimstone when they encountered French weapons designer Vincent Fabron. The encounter did not go smoothly, but it led to Fabron's eventual recruitment into the Protocol, despite the apprehensions of the two senior agents.

		<p>Hailing from the United States, Liam Byrne started his adult life as a firefighter for the BFD and then a military soldier for a Special Forces squad known as the Ragged Ravens. He served in both professions alongside a close friend who he had known since childhood. He also became affiliated with Kingdom Corporation, eventually becoming a veteran of their subsidiary K/SEC.
After the events of First Light, the secretive VALORANT Protocol was founded, with Byrne being the first agent to join them and eventually becoming its leader and commander, "Brimstone".

		>
		<p>Omen is a phantom of a man with mysterious origins and many names. He has a limited memory of his past, though he does remember being involved in something that caused him to be ripped apart and killed. All he knows that links to who he used to be is a place known as Point Light, a past friendship with Sabine "Viper" Callas, and feelings of restoration with every kill he makes. Contributing to the formation of the VALORANT Protocol, Omen would go on to become it's third recruit and serve as one of its more experienced agents, all while he continues his search for answers about what truly happened to him over a decade ago.

		>
		<p>Amir El Amari (Arabic: اَمير; meaning "prince") hails from Rabat, Morocco. Growing up and living there in poverty at times, his city's resources were depleted due to the activities of Kingdom Corporation in the area, with El Amari harboring a negative view towards them as a result. An information broker who is constantly gathering intel, El Amari mostly keeps the results of his work and his secrets close to his chest - especially those about himself. Going to great lengths to ensure no one can gather secrets on the man who knows all the secrets, El Amari has set up multiple safehouses in order to stay hidden as well as never going anywhere without wearing his black face-concealing mask. Even once recruited by the secretive VALORANT Protocol as its fifth agent, "Cypher", El Amari still keeps his face and identity hidden from his fellow agents. For now, nothing is worth the risk of removing his mask - not even for those closest to him.[

		<p>Hailing from the town of Severomorsk, in Murmansk Oblast, Russia, Sasha Novikov is an archer who became an agent for the VALORANT Protocol as its sixth recruit, "Sova". With his right eye replaced with a mechanical one after he lost it, Sova primarily serves as the team's scout, gathering information and searching for targets using olden methods should technology come up short. Being highly capable and reliable both in the field and with his work, whilst also having experience with multiple radianite-related events (having traveled through a rift and having met his Omega counterpart), Sova has earned a reputation of being one of the Protocol's most trusted agents, especially to the organization's commander, Brimstone.

		<p>Ling Ying Wei is a Radiant monk coming from China. Going on to become an agent for the VALORANT Protocol as its seventh recruit, "Sage", Ling was able to work her way quickly up the ranks, becoming the Protocol's second-in-command under Brimstone and over more veteran agents. Sage is currently active in VALORANT's radiant agent recruitment and training, interacting with multiple new radiants upon recruitment and taking the lead on its radiant training program.

		>
		<p>Jamie Adeyemi is a Radiant hailing from the Peckham district in London, England. Growing up, Adeyemi attended a Performing Arts school in the area but was later suspended. Recruited into the VALORANT Protocol as its ninth agent, "Phoenix", Adeyemi was heavily involved with the Protocol's activities from 10 AFL onwards. With much information kept from him as need-to-know as a recent recruit, he was unable to prevent a spike detonation in Venice whilst on a solo mission. Phoenix was given another opportunity to stop one the next day when another attack occurred in Rabat, and it was here that he first came face-to-face with the sole perpetrator, his own Omega counterpart. Frustrated with how much was being kept in the dark, despite going on to prevent the detonation this time with the help of a team, Phoenix was finally filled in on the threat posed by Omega Earth.

		>
		<p>A criminal from Sweden, Erik Torsten was set to be convicted along with the rest of his family for their crimes. As he was a double congenital amputee however, the judge was pitiful and lenient towards him, giving him a smaller sentence that soon allowed Erik to return to his old ways. Building himself his own mechanical arms to use, Erik would hit back with his own criminal assignments, becoming so notorious for the terrible things he had done that he eventually had to go into hiding and effectively exile himself from his home. During these times, he also encountered the young Brazilian Tayane Alves, who worked alongside him for a while and provided some major upgrades to his arms, resulting in the carbon-steel titanium-plating version that he uses to this day.

Later approached to become a VALORANT agent, Torsten accepted the offer though his induction was not a smooth affair. Leaving behind his criminal life in line with VP procedure, his records were sealed and he became the Protocol's thirteenth agent, "Breach". Despite now serving for the secret organization with more dignified actions however, the consequences of his criminal past forever remain, leaving him a man that, for all he does now, can still never truly return home.
